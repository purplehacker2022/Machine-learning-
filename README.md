I reviewed at least 10 previous researches done on Groundwater Analysis to understand the need to use machine learning in analysis.
I implemented the project using various python libraries like (Pandas, Numpy, etc) to predict the groundwater Quality.
I also used various visualization tools and libraries such as (Matlplotlib, Seaborn, etc) to understand what is actually happening to the data.
This project is done for research purposes.
